# New-Mexico-Botanical-Data-Synthesis
This repo contains static scripts associated with the published synthesis of all botanical collections data from New Mexico (Lombardi, Faust and Marx; *Ecosphere*). Users should feel free to clone, download or otherwise up-cycle this work.

## R Scripts
Scripts are custom and addressed the objectives of a specific project, but were written with future users in mind. While it is inevitable that some things will not work without revision and user-specific changes, we hope that most are simple, accessible and withstand the test of software updates. Dynamic versions of these scripts (and complementary materials associated with botanical data analysis in New Mexico) are available on [@EMLgit's personal page](https://github.com/EMLgit).

## Data
Occurrence data for collections made in New Mexico between 1800 and 2022 are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13936206). Environmental data layers were chosen based on public accessibility. Information for each of the layers we used in our initial analyses can be found in the supplementary table in Appendix S1 (Figure 1). We encourage users to find geospatial resources that suit specific research questions in vector or raster format; there are examples of how we cleaned and analyzed each type in the scripts. 

## Please feel free to use and revise our scripts as you see fit. Cite the paper (reference coming).
